# Project 2

## Group: Laura, Ayo, Scott and Mark

## Project Description
Using the dataset 500 Cities: Census Tract level provided from CDC on Chronic Diseases and Health Promotion Data and indicators to compare various relationship measures against indexes related to environmental and lifestyle factors such as  nutrition, healthcare and toxic releases.These high-quality, small-area epidemiologic data can be used both by individual cities and groups of cities as well as other stakeholders to help develop and implement effective and targeted prevention activities; identify emerging health problems; and establish and monitor key health objectives. For example, state and federal planners and elected officials may want to use these data to target cities with high rates of smoking or other health risk behaviors for effective interventions.Hence, this group has become consulting group for the state government.This project will enable retrieval, visualization, and exploration of a uniformly- defined selected city and tract-level data for the largest 500 US cities for conditions, behaviors, and risk factors that have a substantial effect on population health.
